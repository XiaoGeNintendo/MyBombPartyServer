# MyBombPartyServer
This is a basic Kotlin Ktor Websocket server implementation for an imitation of [jklm.fun](https://jklm.fun/)'s minigame: Bomb Party. 
Currently it is used as a practise for myself but you are welcome to do contributions as well!

This project also includes a way-too-simple client for testing. For other clients, please refer to [Unity implementation repo](https://github.com/XiaoGeNintendo/MyBombPartyClientUnity).
